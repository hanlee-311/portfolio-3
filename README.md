## Description
I am a Biology graduate looking to switch careers from reading genetic code to writing computer code. I suppose the art of code has been coded into my DNA! 

There are three things in life that I enjoy more than anything else: creating, organization, and puzzle-solving. I like to get my mind working, my fingers moving, and to put things together. There is nothing like the feeling that seeing your hard work take physical shape, or to finally solve that lingering problem. No matter what the project is, there is always some form of pleasure to derive from problem-solving and creating!

Over the course of my new-found career, I have started to build up examples of what I can do with code. Think that I may be the person for your upcoming project? Take a look through my work and let my code speak for itself!
